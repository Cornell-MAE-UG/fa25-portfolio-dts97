## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/headshot.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Daniel Simoes, and I am a senior Mechanical Engineering major studying at Cornell University. I have a strong passion for engineering and enjoy learning as much as I can. I actively seek opportunities in which I can learn new skills and expand my knowledge of the engineering world. Along with my academics, I am able to pursue my love of athletics as captain of the Cornell Men's Swimming and Diving Team. Within athletics, I am a member of the Red Key Athletic Honor Society, in which I connect with other student leaders and volunteer in the Ithaca community.
