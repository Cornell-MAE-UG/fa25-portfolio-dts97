Throughout and engineering communications course, we examined the Boeing 737 MAX accidents as a comprehensive case study in engineering decision-making, system integration, and professional responsibility. The focus centered on the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), a software function introduced to address handling differences caused by larger, repositioned engines on the 737 MAX compared to earlier variants. MCAS was designed to automatically command nose-down stabilizer inputs during certain high angle-of-attack conditions in order to preserve handling qualities similar to previous models. The case study emphasized that, while MCAS was intended as a limited augmentation, its integration into the aircraft created significant systemic risk, which led to the horrific crashes.

A major theme of the analysis was the technical design of MCAS and its reliance on a single angle-of-attack sensor for activation. It became clear how this design choice created a single point of failure, allowing erroneous sensor data to repeatedly trigger nose-down trim commands without any dual confirmation. The authority granted to MCAS, combined with its ability to reset and re-engage, overwhelmed flight crews and made manual recovery extremely difficult. These technical shortcomings illustrated how software behavior can dominate aircraft dynamics when not constrained by robust system safeguards.

Another critical aspect of the case study involved human factors and pilot awareness. MCAS was not prominently documented in flight manuals, nor was it emphasized in pilot training materials. It was incorrectly assumed that these oversights would not cause problems because MCAS would operate transparently and infrequently. This lack of pilot transparency violated key principles of human-machine interaction, as pilots were confronted with uncommanded aircraft behavior without sufficient information to diagnose the cause. The resulting confusion during high-workload situations significantly contributed to the severity of the accidents.

The case study also addressed organizational and regulatory influences on the development and certification of the 737 MAX. Schedule pressure, cost constraints, and competitive market forces shaped engineering decisions, including the desire to minimize pilot retraining requirements. Additionally, the delegation of certification tasks and reduced regulatory oversight were concluded as contributing factors that allowed design vulnerabilities to persist. This portion of the case study brought to light several violations with the ASME ethical principles and canons by Boeing, and it showed how institutional processes can indirectly affect technical safety outcomes.

Overall, the Boeing 737 MAX MCAS case study served as a clear illustration of the interconnected nature of engineering design, software reliability, human factors, and ethical responsibility. We highlighted the importance of conservative design practices, redundancy, and clear communication between engineers, regulators, and end users. Most importantly, the case emphasized the obligation of engineers to prioritize public safety above commercial or organizational pressures, demonstrating how failures at multiple levels can combine to produce catastrophic consequences.
